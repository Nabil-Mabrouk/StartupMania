# How AI is Scraping, Validating, and Coding 100 Startups in Real-Time

## Introduction
In the previous posts, I introduced the idea of launching 100 startups in a weekend and explained the powerful tools and frameworks behind the challenge. Now it’s time for action! The CrewAI agents and OpenAI GPT are in motion, and we’re beginning the real work of launching these startups. In this post, I’ll walk you through the first steps of automation: how the AI agents scrape ideas from social media, how they validate those ideas, and how OpenAI GPT generates the code for each app.

This is where things get exciting. The pace is fast, and the process is happening in real-time. With AI-driven automation, we’re rapidly moving from idea to code to deployment—all while making data-driven decisions at every step. So, let’s dive in and see how this is all unfolding.
