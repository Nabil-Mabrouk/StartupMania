"This weekend, I’m taking on a wild challenge: launching 100 startups in 48 hours. Here's the plan:
1️⃣ I’ll scrape social media for trending ideas.
2️⃣ Turn ideas into Django apps (features → code → QA).
3️⃣ Deploy each app to a Linux server using an automated script.
4️⃣ Style with TailwindCSS for quick, purpose-driven front-ends.
